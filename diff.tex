%%Research highlights
\begin{highlights}
\item This research proposes the "Chat with MES" (CWM), a novel MES operation paradigm.
CWM offers an alternative to the graphical user interface by enabling users to interact with the MES system through linguistic commands.
\item To handle complex users' requests in manufacturing, the Multi-step Dynamical Operations Generation is proposed to automatically break down the intricate task as a chain of basic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{operations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{executable operations with parameter placeholders}\DIFaddend .
The decomposition significantly enhances the controllability and reliability of the LLM and facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge.
\item An experimental environment was established using a simulated garment manufacturing system. Furthermore, a question-and-answer dataset comprising 55 manually crafted queries was created to serve as a new benchmark for the task of operating a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) through conversation. 
The CWM exhibits a commendable execution success rate of 80\%, surpassing the performance of the original GPT-4, which records a success rate of 60\%.
% The improvement ensures the controllability and reliability of CWM in serious manufacturing scenarios.
% \item 
% A brand-new simulation of production data within a small garment manufacturing system was implemented. 

% To address the limitations of general LLMs in handling complex tasks that require strong prior knowledge, this study introduces the Multi-step Dynamical Operation Generation technique, which guides large language models (LLMs) in decomposing a complex task into a series of basic executable operations. With this technique, the execution accuracy of CWM in handling complex requests is improved by over 18\%, reaching 80\%.

\section{Introduction}

The Manufacturing Execution System (MES) has undergone significant evolution since its inception in the late 19th century, becoming an integral part of modern manufacturing due to its crucial role in production process management and optimization~\cite{doi:10.1080/09537280902938613}. 
With the rapid development of MES in incorporating more complicated functions and operational workflows, the methods by which workers interact with MES warrant more attention~\cite{9781176}. 
Efficient and friendly interaction will significantly reduce the workload of workers and the training cost for new employees.

% Despite its importance, MES faces several challenges, particularly in environments where production processes are complex and involve intricate logic.

Since the Graphical User Interface \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(GUI) }\DIFaddend appeared~\cite {martinez2011graphical}, 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it has become }\DIFaddend the primary way \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{through which workers operate a MESis the Graphical User Interface.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for workers to operate an MES.
%DIF >  it the primary way through which workers operate an MES is the .
}\DIFaddend Users manipulate the graphical elements within a specific system page and receive feedback from the changeable elements.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Although the frameworks for developing GUI , including web pages and application pages, have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The GUI is typically developed alongside the core components of the MES by the software engineering team.
Although the GUI in has }\DIFaddend evolved over several decades and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend sufficiently mature, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{they }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it }\DIFaddend still suffer some limitations in real developments and utilization.
%DIF >  Although the frameworks for developing GUI, including web pages and application pages, have evolved over several decades 
The first limitation arises from the programmers responsible for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{development.
Developing and maintaining an MES , as a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coding.
%DIF >  Developing and maintaining an MES, as a non-standardized and customized software, demands substantial labor effort.
Because MES is a kind of }\DIFaddend non-standardized and customized software, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it }\DIFaddend demands substantial labor effort \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for developing and maintaining the GUI}\DIFaddend .
Even after project delivery, users may still present various new requirements and the developers have to intervene and revise the logic of software and data access interfaces.
Many MES development projects fail and are abandoned by factory users because the development team refuses to continue maintaining the systems\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{pr10112173}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .
The second issue is the learning cost and operational complexity for users.
A new worker must thoroughly learn from the software guidelines and undergo training before performing operations.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In the utilization stage, the workload is also significant due to numerous repetitive and tedious operations.
}\DIFaddend For systems designed for extremely complicated manufacturing processes, the cost \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of training an experienced MES operator }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for developing and using GUI }\DIFaddend is much more substantial~\cite{li2022application}.

% Literature Review
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To reduce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Advanced software engineering methods are suggested to address challenges in development and implementation. 
From the perspective of reducing }\DIFaddend the labor cost of software development and maintenance,
emerging software development techniques have explored paradigms such as no-code~\cite{rokis2022challenges} and low-code~\cite{cabot2020positioning} development platforms.
However, these platforms face \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{challenges in the development of MES}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{usability--plasticity dilemma}\DIFaddend .
% High cost of learning new software and frameworks.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The major one is the trade-off between usability and extensibility: 
%DIF <  Components encapsulation can enhance usability and reduce the development cost.
With component encapsulation , individuals without programming experience can quickly build }\DIFdelend %DIF >  The major one is the trade-off between usability and extensibility. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Component encapsulation allows non-programmers to swiftly create }\DIFaddend a software system through drag-and-drop interfaces.
However, excessive encapsulation will adversely affect extensibility, making it impossible to meet \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users' }\DIFdelend customized needs.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{From a worker's experience standpoint in relation to usage, Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{siderska2020robotic} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
has garnered substantial interest as a means of automating repetitive and labor-intensive business processes through software bots.
However, the functions of most RPA engines are generally limited to specific workflows and certain GUI pages.
They merely serve as supplemental tools to the GUI rather than substitutes for addressing the underlying drawbacks of GUI.
}\DIFaddend % When the platform cannot meet the user's customized needs, embedding natively developed pages becomes very challenging.

Recent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{advancements }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{advances }\DIFaddend in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize the interaction between humans and information systems.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is }\DIFdelend %DIF > ======================================================================

%DIF > ======================================================================
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This can be }\DIFaddend achieved by understanding \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend user requirements expressed in natural language and invoking the services within the information system\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, such as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
Some successful cases have been observed in }\DIFaddend Web Shopping~\cite{yao2022webshop} and Web Browsing\cite{deng2024mind2web}.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Accessing an MES through }\DIFaddend a conversational interface \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as the user interface}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{powered by an LLM is straightforward}\DIFaddend .

% This manuscript presents a platform entitled "Chat with MES" (CWM) that is specifically developed to supplant the conventional graphical user interface of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) with conversational interactions. Figure
Figure~\ref{fig:cmp_MES_CWM} presents the differences between using CWM and traditional GUI to manipulate MES.

\textbf{1) Query Rewriting}: This module addresses the problem of ambiguous and inaccurate user inputs by maintaining a private context base to record named entity information and rewrite users' requests. 
% Additionally, it employs multi-turn dialogues to gather more information and eliminate ambiguities.
\textbf{2) Multi-step Dynamical Operations Generation}:

Meanwhile, RPA remains dependent on GUI interfaces, the cost of developing GUI is unavoidable.

AI }\DIFaddend can be incorporated into the interface layer for MES to create better user-friendly experiences. 
Mantravadi et al.~\cite{mantravadi2020user} proposed the concept of AI-based chatbot assistance, which aims at production coordination by assisting the shop floor workforce and providing easy information
extraction in manufacturing.
Their developed prototype shows that MES users can benefit from an interactive chatbot by creating more dynamic and free experiences.
Colabianchi et al.~\cite{colabianchi2023human} presented an integrated conceptual architecture to develop industrial conversational agents and illustrated the elements needed for the development. 
They also overlooked the application of LLMs in manufacturing conversation systems.
The research discussed above primarily stays at the conceptual or prototype development stage. 
A significant gap exists between the conceptual design and the development of a fully operational conversational system.

\subsection{LLM-based Text2SQL}
One primary function of MES is managing the production data by accessing the production databases. 
To address the wide range of potential queries from users, the proposed CWM will act as a database operating agent between the user and the database. 
Text2SQL parsing~\cite{li2024codes} aims at converting natural language questions into executable SQLs. 
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude-2 have shown impressive results in this task. Some production-ready projects are also developed, such as DB-GPT~\cite{xue2023dbgpt} and sqlcoder~\footnote{https://github.com/defog-ai/sqlcoder}.
However, according to the test results from a large-scale \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{test-to-SQL }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Text2SQL }\DIFaddend benchmark, the most effective \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{text-to-SQL }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Text2SQL }\DIFaddend models achieve 54.89\% in execution accuracy, whereas human experts achieve approximately 92.96\%~\cite{li2024can}. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Intrinsically, Text2SQL is a code generation technology that transforms detailed and precise natural language requests into SQL commands. 
In practical applications, it must incorporate business-related prior knowledge alongside Text2SQL to accurately identify users' requirements and generate executable SQL commands.
}\DIFaddend By designing specific workflows and incorporating additional \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{prior }\DIFdelend knowledge through prompt engineering, the performance of Text2SQL in practical applications has been improved significantly. 
As an extension of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NL2SQL}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Text2SQL}\DIFaddend , ChatBI is proposed to convert Natural Language to Business Intelligence~\cite{lian2024chatbi}, effectively addressing challenges related to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{limited interaction modes and }\DIFdelend a large number of columns. 
To address complex queries requiring multi-step database operations rather than a single SQL command, ChatDB~\cite{hu2023chatdb} and Din-SQL~\cite{pourreza2024din} augment LLMs to generate multi-step and dynamical SQL instructions for database manipulation. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, existing LLM-based business intelligence systems are generally applied in non-intrusive data query scenarios to avoid the catastrophic consequences of hallucinatory data editing.
In our study, manipulating MES inevitably involves a number of update, insert, and delete operations. 
The chosen operations and their order must be absolutely accurate. 
This places extremely high requirements on the agent. 
Not only does the agent need to understand all database's schemas and their relationships, but it also needs to follow the production guidelines.
}\DIFaddend % As a fundamental technology, Text2SQL is still distant from enabling conversational interactions with real Manufacturing Execution System (MES) databases. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Within the operational framework of a Manufacturing Execution System (MES ), addressing user requests entails the complex task of dataset record manipulation, which proves to be significantly more challenging.

% However, by designing specific workflows and incorporating additional prior knowledge through prompt engineering,  the performance of Text2SQL in practical applications has been improved significantly. As an extension of NL2SQL, the ChatBI is proposed to convert Natural Language to Business Intelligence~\cite{lian2024chatbi}, effectively addressing challenges related to limited interaction modes and a large number of columns. 


\subsection{LLM Agent}
% LLM-based single-agent systems (SAS) use a single LLM agent for complex task solving, such as travel planning, personalized recommendation, and artistic design
% \cite{ge2024openagi}
% The agent is a system that may encounter various issues such as execution anomalies, tool invocation errors, and high real-time processing, which need to be analyzed and resolved in order to ensure stable operation.
An AI agent is capable of perceiving the environment, making decisions~\cite{wu2024processcarbonagent}, and taking actions~\cite{DBLP:conf/acl/ZengLLWLD024}. 
LLM has become an ideal foundation model for advancing AI agents toward broad and versatile functionality \cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/0036YZXLL0DMYZ024}. 
An LLM agent takes charge of a defined set of tools, each accompanied by a textual description delineating its functionality and input/output parameters, with an LLM performing the role of the scheduler. 
Given a complex problem, the LLM generates the plan via Chain-of-Thought~\cite{wei2022chain} and sequentially invokes approximate tools with parameters extracted from the context. 
In manufacturing, most systems provide standardized API and protocols for integrating with other software~\cite {SHOJAEINASAB2022503}. 
Functioning as a mediator between human operators and the MES, the CWM needs to engage with the MES through these pre-established APIs. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The study introduces the LLM-Agent to invoke MES tools and services automatically}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For integration of the LLM into serious and complicated manufacturing contexts, it is crucial that the agent's inferences and behaviors are transparent, explainable, and controllable~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{delser2024counterfactual}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

%DIF >  Recent advancements in explainable AI (XAI) have shown that LLMs can be used to generate trustworthy counterfactual explanations~\cite{delser2024counterfactual}.

\DIFaddend \subsection{Application of LLM in Manufacturing systems}
In the context of Industry 4.0, the rapid emergence of LLM has brought forth transformative solutions for manufacturers in processing and leveraging their data efficiently. 
LLMs are increasingly being used as conversational agents, serving as an intuitive interface between humans and the manufacturing environment~\cite{colabianchi2023human}. 
This section aims to analyze the differences between this paper and other studies that apply large models in the manufacturing field.
% This integration enables seamless communication between operators and machines, bridging cognitive gaps and fostering real-time decision-making 
Sun et al. ~\cite{sun2024empowering} propose an AI-driven digital-twin (DT) multi-agent architecture powered by LLMs to enhance equipment maintenance scenarios, offering novel insights into predictive and preventive maintenance strategies. 
% This kind of intelligence-driven architecture facilitates more efficient predictive maintenance frameworks and data-driven asset management within industrial ecosystems.
Furthermore, the application of LLMs extends beyond conversational agents and into more specialized areas such as robotics programming. In a ROS (Robot Operating System) environment, Xia et al. demonstrate how LLM-driven code generation can be harnessed to enable more efficient robot operations~\cite{XIA2024102728}. 
% This use of LLMs in dynamic programming environments showcases AI’s ability to optimize and speed up traditionally time-consuming processes, highlighting its remarkable potential in enhancing operational efficiency.
Li et al.~\cite{li2024building} further explore the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs, leveraging the symbiotic relationship between these technologies to aid in sourcing and identifying smaller manufacturing partners. 
% By interfacing with ChatGPT, manufacturers can query expansive data sets to pinpoint potential collaborators, thereby increasing flexibility and agility within supply chains.
Additionally, Xu et al.~\cite{xu2024llm} incorporate LLMs in collaborative design processes where LLMs generate design prompts for tools like DALL-E, facilitating the rapid and seamless creation of precise visual schemes.
In the realm of industrial sustainability, Wu introduces the ProcessCarbonAgent framework, which uses LLMs to analyze root causes of carbon emissions and improve decision-making for industrial emission management~\cite{wu2024processcarbonagent}. 
% This innovative system exemplifies the application of LLMs in environmental management, providing manufacturers with AI-driven insights to meet ever-increasing sustainability goals. 
These studies illustrate the transformative influence LLMs hold within numerous aspects of manufacturing, ranging from robot manipulation and design collaboration to supply chain enhancement and cause analyses.
The LLM functions not only as a chatbot or writer but also as a coordinator that integrates services and processes information from multiple sources.
Table~\ref{tab:comparison} highlights the differentiating factors of CWM in comparison to preceding research efforts. 
Given that each related work addresses unique research questions, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs that are employed. 
CWM represents the first dialogue-oriented open-source framework endowed with functionalities including Code Generation, database access, and Tool invocation.

%% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics#Importing_external_graphics
\end{figure}
The overall framework of CWM is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:cwm_framework}.
Upon receiving a textual request from the user, the CWM undergoes three stages, Request Rewriting, Multi-Step Dynamical Operations Generation, and Responses Generation.
To eliminate ambiguities from the user's original commands, the Request Rewriter uses an LLM to substitute entities in the request with precise descriptions that can be indexed in the database.
The Multi-step Dynamical Operations Generation develops a plan with step-by-step operations to handle the request and dynamically updates these operations.
The final stage, Responses Generation, summarizes the results from executing the operations and generates a textual response in markdown format for the user.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In this section , we focus on detailing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This section introduces the technical details of }\DIFaddend the Request Rewriter and Multi-step Dynamical Operations Generation processes.


\subsection{Request Rewriter for Preprocess}
When users interact with the CWM, they may \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{provide }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{input }\DIFaddend non-standardized or ambiguous information, which can introduce significant information bias in subsequent database operations.
% However, customers or workers are prone to providing non-standardized or ambiguous information to the CWM.
For example, both "PolyU" and "Hong Kong Polytechnic University" refer to the same entity associated with a record in the customer table.
If the real name stored in the database is "PolyU", once the user inputs "Hong Kong Polytechnic University" as the customer information, a generated SQL command may carry a wrong retrieve condition.
% The first step that the CWM shoub
Therefore, the first technical module of CWM is developed to
standardize the query for Entity disambiguation.

% The foundation of CWM is transforming user's natural language queries into a series of basic operations.
In an MES, a request, such as assigning a task to a worker or placing an order for a customer, typically involves a series of complex operations.
To increase the controllability and reliability of CWM in handling complicated requests, this paper introduces \textbf{Multi-step Dynamical Operations Generation} to transform the natural language input from users to a series of executable basic operations in MES.
%DIF >  This section will describe the details involved in generating and executing these operations.

}\DIFaddend As the most fundamental type of operation, 'SQL' represents accessing the MES database by generating an SQL command tailored to the specific purpose of the step.
The SQL commands are generated by the LLM, which is associated with Text2SQL, a significant and emerging research area in the application of LLMs.

\section{Experiment}
\label{sec:exp}
In this section, we develop a simulated garment MES and design 55 questions to evaluate the effectiveness of CWM for manipulating MES. 
Based on a series of ablation studies, we quantify the improvement by introducing Query Re-writer, Multi-step Operations Generation, and each type of operation.
% According to the experimental results from a simulated garment MES and 55 questions.
This section provides an in-depth introduction to the experimental design and results.

The constructed MES system incorporates the fundamental management components typical of garment manufacturing facilities, encompassing orders, customers, workers, materials, cutting operations, and sewing operations. 
The database in this simulated MES is a relational database involving 16 tables.
Their relations and foreign keys are shown in the ER diagram \ref{fig:er_diagram}.
We use the GPT-4 to generate the simulated data in the database, resulting in a total of 312 records.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Requests Dataset}
Based on the database schema of the MES and the rows inside, we designed a requests dataset including 55 requests covering common operations in a garment factory: placing orders, checking inventory, work assignment, materials allocation, and so on.
We use the term 'request' instead of 'question' because it involves many commands rather than simply posing a question.
In actual production settings, requests may be initiated by two categories of users, workers and managers. Figure~\ref{fig:req_source} illustrates the distribution of the identities among 55 requests.
As the production manager is responsible for coordinating production tasks, workers, and resources, he is the primary user of CWM.
% Customer requests primarily involve placing orders and checking the progress of production.
Workers use this system to confirm allocated tasks and report their working progress.

Theoretically, all requests can be addressed using basic database operations--Inserting (I), Updating (U), and Querying (Q) and their combination to adjust the records in the database.
Figure \ref{fig:ques_types} presents the distribution of the required command types involved in all requests.
Most requests are data retrieval tasks which are slightly easier than the tasks requiring Inserting and Updating operations.
Figure~\ref{fig:complexity} evaluates the complexity distribution of requests as determined by the number of database tables involved in each request.
The most complex request requires the CWM to access five tables to complete it.
Approximately ten requests can be easily resolved by accessing only one table.

\end{figure*}

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Evaluation}

We use the execution accuracy across all requests as the primary evaluation metric.
The response given by CWM for a request is regarded as correct when it meets two conditions: 
1) The CWM must adhere to the business logic of the MES and query or update the records in specific tables using either tools or pure SQL commands. 
2) It must consolidate the intermediate results from these operations and deliver a coherent response to the user's request.


The ground truth for requests is developed through semi-automatically process.
Initially, we use the CWM to produce both results and intermediate operation steps.
These outputs are then manually examined for potential inaccuracies.
In instances where errors are identified, additional prompts are consistently provided to the CWM to ensure that it yields the correct responses.
% e consistently provide sufficient hints to the CWM by supplying additional prompts until it produces the correct answers.

% The ground truth for requests is developed through a semi-automated process. Initially, the CWM is utilized to produce both results and intermediate operational steps. These outputs are then manually examined for potential inaccuracies. In instances where errors are identified, additional prompts are consistently provided to the CWM to ensure that it yields the correct responses.

During the evaluation of the CWM and other baselines, we introduce an auxiliary GPT-4o as an adjudicator, determining whether the generated chain of operations, operations commands, and responses closely approximate the ground truth.
For incorrect answers, the judge model is responsible for identifying the category and cause of the error. 
By analyzing the response processes of large models, we identified four types of errors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Information Deviation}: The LLM fails to identify the correct entity information from the user's input. For instance, while the user's request includes the customer name 'PolyU', the officially registered name in the database is 'Hong Kong Polytechnic University'.
    \item \textbf{Wrong CoT}: The LLM either fails to comprehend the user's intention or constructs an incorrect logical chain to address the problem.
    \item \textbf{Wrong Syntax}: There are syntax errors in the generated SQL commands and tool invocation statements.
    \item \textbf{Else}: Other errors that do not fit into the specified categories, such as errors in Mathematical Calculation. 
    % \item \textbf{Wrong Calculation}: The model errs in calculations, such as applying incorrect formulas or extracting incorrect parameters from the context.
\end{itemize}

The four types of errors have a "short-circuit" relationship.
If the model makes the "Information Deviation" error, any occurrences of "Wrong Syntax" and "Wrong CoT" in its response will not be counted.
Beyond evaluating Execution Accuracy and identifying individual errors within each category, we also measure token usage for responding to all requests, as this metric is relevant to cost and significant in practical applications.

\subsubsection{Details of implementing CWM}
All the LLMs used in CWM, including the query rewriting module, multi-step operations planner, and response generator, are based on GPT-4o by default, with their temperatures set to 0 to reduce the stochasticity during generation.
In section \ref{sec:ablation}, ablation studies were conducted to evaluate the selection of the foundational LLM. 
The agent responsible for the coordination of the provided tools is implemented utilizing the LangChain framework. 
% The foundational functions, which encompass chatting, summarizing, and generating multi-step operations, are developed using the OpenAI library.
We use Dify~\footnote{\href{https://github.com/langgenius/dify}{dify.ai}} to construct the graphical chatting window.
% The graphical chatting window is implemented by Dify~\footnote{\href{https://github.com/langgenius/dify}{dify.ai}}.

\subsection{Two cases presenting how CWM handles user's requests}
\label{sec:exp_cases}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Before presenting the quantitative evaluation results, this section provides two examples to demonstrate how CWM handles a user's request.
Table~\ref{tab:case_place_order} presents the initial request, which pertains to the process of placing an order through CWM. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, the request involves two challenges typical in real-world scenarios.
First, the customer name "Hong Kong Polytechnic University" and the product description "Red T-shirt in M size " and "blue sweaters in size XL", are non-standardized references, filled with ambiguity and vagueness.
In our simulated MES, the standardized customer name is "PolyU".
CWM is required to identify the standardized entity names and formulate the appropriate retrieval SQL utilizing "PolyU". 
%DIF <  The second issue is the non-standardized expression.
Meanwhile, the product type, "T-shirt", and the product description, "Red, M size", are decoupled fields in two separate tables.
%DIF <  The engine has to extract two information separately and query the specific ID of "T-shirts"-"size M". 
Consequently, the engine must independently extract these two sets of information and subsequently execute a query for retrieving the ID of "T-shirts" and "size M".
The second challenge is the dependence on a series of complex operations to handle this request, encompassing multi-step queries and insertions across various tables.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Table~\ref{tab:case_place_order} depicts the comprehensive processes through which the CWM addresses this request. 
Within the Query Preprocessing phase, the entities of the original query are transformed into the format }%DIFDELCMD < {%%%
\DIFdel{table-field=information}%DIFDELCMD < }%%%
\DIFdel{. 
The retriever automatically fetches the top-k relevant information about the query, such as customer information (PolyU) and product attributes ("Red, M size" and "Blue, XL size"). 
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{After rewriting the query, the CWM generates an initial chain of operations consisting of eight steps to handle the request. 
Parameters that are initially unknown are marked with placeholders ('<>'), the contents of which will be interpreted based on the outcomes of previous steps.
The Query Re-writer in CWM successfully identifies the inaccurate information contained in the request and matches it with the correct entity in the database. 
The explicit schema and column names are also provided in the revised query.
With this information, the LLM can generate accurate operation commands, incorporating correct field names and conditions.
The hallucination in Text2SQL can be eliminated.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Subsequently, the process delves into the sequence of execution steps.
In Step 1), the LLM first identifies the customer ID based on the provided customer name. 
In Steps 2) and 3), the CWM locates the product IDs for "Red, M size T-shirt" and "Blue, XL size Sweater" (1 and 17, respectively). 
Operations for querying the ID of specified customers and products are executed in a sequential and accurate manner.
In Step 4), a new order is created for the user "PolyU", and the associated products are added in Step 5) and Step 6). 
With respect to task allocation, which necessitates customized rules and domain-specific knowledge within this factory setting, the CWM engages the Tool 'allocate\_task' to fulfill this objective.
The CWM demonstrates a strong understanding of the internal relationships between schemas.

\textbf{Step 5:} Thought, Calculate the total quantity of each raw material used by multiplying the product quantity, WIP material quantity, and original material quantity.\\
Output:\\
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sql_command]
To achieve the objective, we need to calculate the total quantity of each original material used based on the orders, products, WIP materials, and original materials. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Retrieve Order Details:**
   - Orders in June 2024: IDs 10, 11, 12.
   - Order 10: Product ID 30, Quantity 150.
   ...
   
2. **WIP Materials Required for Each Product:**
   - Product ID 30:
     - WIP Material ID 2, Quantity 5.
     - WIP Material ID 10, Quantity 1.
   - Product ID 20:
   ...
   
3. **Original Materials Required for Each WIP Material:**
   - WIP Material ID 2:
     - Original Material ID 1, Quantity 0.4.
   ...
     
4. **Calculate Total Original Materials Used:**
   - **Product ID 30 (150 units):**
     - WIP Material ID 2: 150 * 5 = 750 units
       - Original Material ID 1: 750 * 0.4 = 300
   ...
   
5. **Sum the Quantities for Each Original Material:**

   - Original Material ID 1: 300 + 52.5 + 144 + 192 + 825 + 264 = 1777.5
   - Original Material ID 11: 487.5 + 234 + 1155 = 1876.5
   ...

These are the total quantities of each original material used based on the given orders and material requirements.
\end{lstlisting}\\ \hline
\textbf{Step 6:} Thought, Organize the results into the form of {raw materials: used quantity}.\\
Output:\\
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sql_command]
To compile the calculated quantities from Step 5 into a dictionary format, we will use the raw material names as keys and the total used quantities as values. Here is the dictionary:

\DIFadd{Before presenting the quantitative evaluation results, this section provides two examples to demonstrate how CWM handles a user's request.
Table~\ref{tab:case_place_order} and \ref{tab:case_query_material_without_muti_step} compare CWM to the baseline GPT-4 using a sample request, by analyzing a sample request to query the raw materials consumed for orders in June 2024.
%DIF >  The second example involves the task of querying and summarizing the inventory of materials within the warehouse, as illustrated in Table ~\ref{tab:case_query_material}. 
}\DIFaddend Given that the total material usage is calculated by aggregating the individual usage of each product within each order, a mathematical calculation is necessary to analyze the data retrieved from the previous steps. 
Compared to the previous example, the planned chain of operations includes two 'Thought' steps. 
During Step 5, the CWM utilizes the chain of thought (CoT) methodology to deconstruct this 'Thought' task further. 
This procedure is executed by GPT-4o without any prompts from the CWM. 
Step 6 effectively distills and arranges the retrieved results into the specified format.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Table~\ref{tab:case_query_material_without_muti_step} represents the results executed by the GPT-4o based Text2SQL model. 
The model generates a long SQL command containing three obvious errors marked with purple.
The errors result in no results being retrieved from the database.
The comparison clearly indicates decomposing complex tasks into sub-tasks can effectively reduce complexity, decrease the probability of model errors, and facilitate the incorporation of prior production guidelines into the LLM.
}


\DIFadd{We specifically designed a highly challenging example to demonstrate CWM's capability in solving complex problem.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:case_reorganize_production_plan}, the case involves rearranging the production plan because the expected delivery time of an order has been advanced.
The request involves third typical challenges.
First, the description of the order "dress order of Emily" is non-standardized reference, filled with ambiguity and vagueness.
In our simulated MES, the standardized order name is "Emily\_Dress".
CWM is required to identify the standardized entity names and formulate the appropriate retrieval SQL utilizing "Emily\_Dress". 
The second issue is the CWM must interpret the ambiguous reference, "the group with the minimum number of tasks".
The third challenge is the dependence on a series of complex operations to handle this request, encompassing multi-step queries, invoking tools and thoughts across various tables.
}

\DIFadd{CWM decomposed this task into 20 steps, including 15 SQL operations, 2 Tool operations, and 3 Thought operations. 
Due to the large number of operations, the table omits specific execution logs and results, listing only the types and descriptions of the operations used. 
This example sufficiently demonstrates CWM's capability to replace the GUI in MES, as it can autonomously integrate external services and manipulate the database through natural language input, effectively handling complex requests in the manufacturing process.

This section illustrates the quantitative performance of the CWM in comparison to baseline models as shown in Table \ref{tab:main_tab}.% we compared the quantitative performance of CWM with several baselines.
As two weak baselines, the original GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 are utilized as text2SQL engines to generate a single SQL command for handling the user's request.
The execution accuracy of GPT-4o is 60\%, significantly lower than the solutions based on the CWM architecture. 
This indicates that workflow engineering is essential for enabling the foundational LLM to operate an MES effectively.
Unavoidably, the use of a complex workflow inevitably leads to increased token usage.
% , approximately four times greater than when employing a Large Language Model (LLM) alone.

Considering that the CWM is analogous to the integration of a Request re-writer and Multiple-step operations, we have undertaken an individual assessment of each component's contribution.
The Request re-writer can efficiently tackle the Information Deviation, contributing about 13\% accuracy improvement.
% The Multiple-step Dynamical Operations Generation is the most important part in CWM to reduce the errors and contributes about 18.3\% improvement.
% By breaking a complicated task into several basic steps, generating a SQL command for a single step is much easier and the wrong syntax is efficiently avoided.
The query re-writer effectively addresses Information Deviation, contributing approximately a 9\% increase in accuracy. 
The Multi-step Dynamic Operations Generation is the most crucial component of the CWM, reducing errors and providing an approximate 18.2\% improvement. 
% Decomposing a complex task into simpler constituent steps facilitates the generation of SQL commands for each respective step, significantly minimizing the likelihood of syntax errors. 
% Furthermore, 
Handling the request step-by-step ensures alignment with human intent and pre-existing knowledge within a specified context, thereby leading to a reduction in errors related to both the chain of thought (COT) and computational processes.

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:dist_operation} shows the total times for executing three different kinds of operations at each step for 55 requests.
The process is limited to a maximum of 8 steps. 
Most requests, accounting for 45, can be resolved within 4 steps.
In the initial stages, SQL operations are predominant, as the CWM necessitates data retrieval from the database prior to engaging in subsequent data processing and tool invocation activities. 
The processes involving thought typically take place in the subsequent stages when requests require mathematical computation. 
The integration of these three types of operations is nearly sufficient to address all requests within the CWM.

Within the Multi-step Dynamical Operation framework, the 'Tool' and 'Thought' operations are important in augmenting the precision of CWM's execution.
To measure the impact of each operation type, we performed extensive ablation studies to assess CWM performance when lacking one operation type.
The study further examines how the fundamental LLM in CWM affects performance. 

According to Table~\ref{tab:ablation}, excluding 'Thought' or 'Tool' operations significantly drops CWM execution accuracy. 
The presence of 'Tool' operations provides a marginally greater contribution compared to 'Thought'.% 'Thought' operations help lower calculation errors.
% Just like the example shown in Table \ref{tab:case_query_material} which demonstrates a meticulous approach to retrieve data and logically deducing the answer. 
Without thought processes, the model struggles with reasoning and calculations. 
As most dataset requests are straightforward, removing 'Thought' does not greatly impact performance.

As a greater role in the operations of CWM, the 'Tool' operations are important for handling the requests that require extensive prior knowledge of production, such as task allocation and material allocation.
Without the 'Tool', the CWM must generate a series of complex SQL commands to simulate the functions of the missing tools. 
In this process, commands with incorrect syntax may be produced, and the number of 'Wrong Syntax' will increase.

Finally, we replaced the foundational LLMs in the CWM with other advanced alternatives.
The results demonstrate that the intelligence of the foundation model significantly impacts the CWM's performance.
The CWM based on GPT-3.5 fails to generate syntactically correct SQL.
The accuracy is even lower than that of the GPT-3.5 without the CWM framework.
This suggests that as the cognitive abilities of large models develop and further align with human intentions, the capabilities of CWM can advance in parallel.

 % balance between accuracy and token usage

 % Who should be responsible for wrong operations?

 % 
This study preliminarily implements a chatting interface of MES as a demonstration.
However, it is still far from being applicable in real factory settings and replacing the traditional GUI interfaces.
Three critical issues need to be discussed and addressed for future improvement.

\textbf{Balance between Accuracy, Generality, and Token usage}
execution accuracy can be improved by designing more precise workflows or incorporating additional few-shot examples in prompts. However, this approach is akin to patching, which requires significant manpower and cannot be easily generalized to other MES systems. Additionally, complex workflows or lengthy prompts lead to high LLM token consumption.
% A more extensible 
The CWM is expected to evolve into a more extensible and dynamic framework that can understand database schemas and production business processes at a lower cost.

\textbf{Who should be responsible for incorrect operations?}
A typical MES requires a confirmation step before performing any data adjustment operations.
The operator who confirms the operation is responsible for any unforeseen consequences that may arise.
However, the CWM is a virtual worker who autonomously handles task planning and execution.
A critical issue in this process is determining the responsibility when the LLM performs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{incorrect }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{unreasonable }\DIFaddend operations, even if the user provided correct instructions.
A viable solution is to incorporate a confirmation function in the chat window, where all details of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{data adjustment }\DIFdelend operations are clearly and thoroughly presented. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{If the userresponds with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore, it is meaningful to introduce counterfactual inference~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\textbf{Speaks little but is willing to express a lot.}
% A significant issue appears in our beta testing.
% In contrast to the traditional MES user interface, where developers can specify required fields for each submitted form, users of CWM are often reluctant to provide detailed operational information due to the unrestricted interaction mode.
In the traditional MES user interface, users must provide complete information in the submitted form, as input fields are typically set as mandatory by developers.
In CWM, the free interaction mode can lead users to become lax and inattentive in providing sufficient information.
The chatting agent has to keep inquiring about more information to complete the specified request.
If we strictly limit the question options and required fields in CWM, the characteristic of free chatting is lost, and CWM will degenerate into a typical MES interaction model.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{How to apply the free dialogue to serious scenarios, such as manufacturing , is an important research topic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This dilemma inspires us to consider an important question, what is the best chatting interface for the CWM that is universally applicable, human-centered, and suitable for manufacturing environments?

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This study proposes an LLM agent system, named Chat with MES (CWM), an interface for the operators in garment factories to manipulate a manufacturing execution system based on natural language.
We introduce two key technical advancements: the Query Rewriter and Multi-step Dynamic Operations Generation.
To eliminate entity ambiguity in the user's request, which may lead to erroneous query conditions, the Query Rewriter automatically aligns ambiguous entities in the users' input with the correct entities within the Manufacturing Execution System (MES), such as the names of customers, products, and materials.
To handle complicated manipulation requests on MES, the proposed Multi-step Dynamic Operations Generation combines the chain of thought and external tools to generate SQL commands or invoke MES's services for operating the Manufacturing Execution System (MES).
By evaluating the CWM on a simulated garment MES with 55 manually designed questions, we find that the CWM achieves a high execution success rate of 80\%, compared to GPT-4's 60\%. 
The query rewriter and dynamic Multi-Step SQL generation techniques separately contribute improvements of approximately 10\% and 18\%, respectively.

% Based on a query rewriter, ambiguous entities in the customer's input are automatically aligned with the correct entities within the Manufacturing Execution System (MES), including customers, products, materials, and more.


% A case study conducted on a simulated garment MES with 50 artificial questions demonstrates the high execution accuracy of CWM (80\%) and the improvement brought by query rewriter (12.8\%) and Multi-Step Dynamic SQL generation (18.3\%).
